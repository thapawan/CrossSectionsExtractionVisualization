# CrossSectionsExtractionVisualization (CSEV)
The cross-section extraction visualization tool automates extracting cross-sections with their horizontal distance and elevation. The repository contains notebooks and ArcGIS Pro Tool for cross-section extraction and visualization.

## Usage Guide
The easiest and quickest way to use the cross-section extraction visualization tool is to run it from ArcPro Toolboxes, where the functions can be directly loaded without setup. 


### Example usage
extract_and_visualize_cross_sections('Data\Shapefiles\Cross sections.shp', 'Data\DEM.tif', n_points=3, csv_output_dir='Samples', png_output_dir='Samples')
